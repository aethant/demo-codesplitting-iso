Very, _very_ basic demo of [universal-react-component](https://github.com/faceyspacey/react-universal-component). Not pretty, but it shows the principle behind it.

Used [this article](https://medium.com/faceyspacey/announcing-react-universal-component-2-0-babel-plugin-universal-import-5702d59ec1f4) as a basis for creating this demo, as I'll need to use isomorphic code splitting in a work project in the near future and wanted a PoC for myself.

PRs welcome.
